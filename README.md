# Car Inventory System

## Description
The **Car Inventory System** is a simple web application built using JavaScript and HTML that allows users to manage a car inventory. You can add cars with their details, display the list of cars, and calculate the total inventory price after depreciation. Demonstrating the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript.

## Features
- **Add a Car**: Enter car details (name, model, year, price) to add a car to the inventory.
- **Display Inventory**: View the list of cars, including their depreciated prices.
- **Calculate Total Price**: Calculate the total value of the car inventory after depreciation.

## Depreciation Logic
- The price of each car depreciates by **$500 per year** based on the age of the car.
- The price will not go below **$0**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic, including car inventory management, depreciation calculations, and dynamic interaction with the UI.


## How to Run the Project:

- Simply Click the Link:  
https://owenguske.github.io/Car_Inventory_System/
 

3. **Open the Project**:
   - Navigate to the 'index.html' to read the code allowing for user interface
   - Navigate to the 'script.js' to read the code allowing for logic, management, depreciation, and dynamic UI.

### How to Effectively Use the Program
1. **Add a Car**:
   - Enter the car's name, model, manufacture year, and price in the form.
   - Click **"Add Car"** to add the car to the inventory list.

2. **View Inventory**:
   - The added cars will be displayed in the inventory list along with their depreciated prices.

3. **Calculate Total Price**:
   - Click **"Calculate Total Price"** to view the total value of all cars after depreciation.

## Code Structure
- **`index.html`**: Contains the structure of the web page, including the form for adding cars, the inventory list, and buttons.
- **`script.js`**: Implements the logic using JavaScript, including the `Car` and `CarManager` classes.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- The project uses OOP principles by defining two classes:
  - **Car**: Represents a car with properties like `name`, `model`, `year`, and `price`. Includes a method to calculate price depreciation.
  - **CarManager**: Manages the car inventory, including adding cars, displaying the list, and calculating the total price.
